      <h1>.....NATURE.....</h1>
        <h2>NATURE includes all the living things and non-living things around us</h2>
        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>Nature refers to the interaction between the physical surroundings around us and life within it like atmosphere, climate, natural resources, ecosystem, flora, fauna and humans. Nature is indeed "GOD'S PRECIOUS GIFT TO EARTH". It is the primary source of all the necessities for the nourishment of all living beings on earth. Right from the food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the house we live in is provided by nature. Nature is called "MOTHER NATURE" because just like our mother, she is always nurturing us with all our needs.
        </p>
        <h2>Importance of Nature</h2>
        <p>The health benefits of nature for humans are incredible. 
            The most important thing for survival given by nature is oxygen.
            The entire cycle of respiration is regulated by nature.
            The oxygen that we inhale is given by trees and the carbon dioxide we exhale is getting absorbed by trees.
        </p>
